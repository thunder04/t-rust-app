# Rust Application Template

My template for creating a basic Rust application. It features
logging using the [`tracing`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) library,
[`color_eyre`](https://crates.io/crates/color_eyre) for pretty panic reports,
and [`thiserror`](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) for specialized error handling.
